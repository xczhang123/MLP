The results of experiment and ablation study can be found in MultiLayerPerceptron.ipynb

Before running the notebook, make sure to maintain the folder structure the same as downloaded:
    | COMP5329
        | assignments
            | assignment1
                | datasets
                    | test_data.npy
                    | test_label.npy
                    | train_data.npy
                    | train_label.npy
                | MultiLayerPerceptron.ipynb
                | data_utils.py
                | fc_net.py
                | gradient_check.py
                | layer_utils.py
                | layers.py
                | optim.py

What each file do:
    - MultiLayerPerceptron.ipynb: main notebook
    - dataset: The folder contains both the training data and test data for the experiments
    - data_utils.py: The file contains a data utility function to read in the dataset required for training and testing
    - fc_net.py: The file contains the implementation for the MLP model         
    - gradient_check: The file contains the codes for numerical gradient checking (against analytical from back propagation)
    - layers.py: The file contains all layers implemented in the network
    - layer_utils.py: The file contains multiple composite of layers (from layers.py) that are commonly used for ease of access
    - optim.py: This file implements various first-order update rules that are commonly used for training neural networks.

To run the notebook:
    - if on Google Colab: 
        Upload the downloaded folder named as "COMP5329" (or change Line 5 to match your file path)
        Navigate to the 'Runtime' bar and click 'Run all' in the dropdown menu
    - if on local jupyter notebook:
        Please comment out Line 1 through 8 of the notebook and execute as above

It takes approximately 20-30 minutes to finish running the whole notebook, depending on the hardware.
